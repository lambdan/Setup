# NZXT Kraken Without Using CAM

## Pre-reqs

- This is all dependent on [liquidctl](https://github.com/jonasmalacofilho/liquidctl)
- You need Python installed for the random color script (and liquidctl but it's bundled in the release exe for liquidctl)
- I recommend putting everything in a folder that is in your `%PATH%`. Read more here: [Path Setup](https://github.com/lambdan/Setup/blob/master/Windows/Path%20Setup.md). From here on I refer to it as _Path_.
- I use Windows so therefore I use `.bat` files for their simplicity. All of this should work fine on Unix systems if you just translate them to Bash scripts
- I have only tested with _NZXT Kraken X62_, as that is the cooler I have

## Steps

- Put [liquidctl.exe](https://github.com/jonasmalacofilho/liquidctl/releases) in a folder (I recommend _Path_)
- Put `kraken_init.bat` in the same folder	
- Put `kraken_random_color.py` in the same folder
- Run `kraken_init.bat` and make sure it works (it should set the speeds and you should get random RGB on the waterblock)
- Make a shortcut to `kraken_init.bat`. Put it in [Windows' Autostart folder](https://www.howtogeek.com/228467/how-to-make-a-program-run-at-startup-on-any-computer/).

Now whenever your computer restarts and Windows starts up, your Kraken should be automatically configured.

## Optional Steps

- Remove the `pause` line from `kraken_init.bat`. This way the window will automatically go away. I like to leave it on to make sure everything went well. Especially if you dont have a windowed case I would recommend leaving it in.
- Put `liqs.bat` in _Path_. This way you can type `liqs` (**liq**uid **s**tatus) into any cmd window to monitor your Kraken.
- Make a shortcut to `liqs.bat` and put it in your Autostart folder. This way the monitor window comes up automatically.
- Put `krakc.bat` in _Path_. This way you can type `krakc` (**krak**en **c**olor) into any cmd window to get new random colors on the waterblock.
- Modify Pump and Fan Speed by modifying the lines in `kraken_init.bat`. Read [liquidctl's Kraken specific documentation](https://github.com/jonasmalacofilho/liquidctl/blob/master/docs/nzxt-kraken-x-3rd-generation.md) to figure out how.
- Make your own color scheme by reading [liquidctl's Kraken specific documentation](https://github.com/jonasmalacofilho/liquidctl/blob/master/docs/nzxt-kraken-x-3rd-generation.md) to set up your own scheme, or mess around with `kraken_random_color.py`.

## Explanation of kraken_init.bat

- We set the color to red to know that we aren't configured yet: `liquidctl.exe set sync color fixed ff0000`
	- If something goes wrong, it should stay red, and that way we with windowed cases know something isn't right.

- We set the pump speed to constant 80%: `liquidctl.exe set pump speed 80 --verbose`
	- This equates to roughly 2400 rpm.
	- This is the highest I can have it without hearing it. YMMV.
	- You can also just not set a pump speed and let it run at the default 2000 rpm. It doesn't make a big difference in temperature.
	- The `--verbose` option could be removed but it's nice to see for confirmation.

- We set a custom fan curve: `liquidctl.exe set fan speed 34 50 40 100 --verbose`
	- Fans will run at 50% until the liquid temperature hits 34째C.	
		- In my experience the liquid doesn't get over 34째C in idle. YMMV once again.
		- 50% with my _Corsair ML140 PRO RGB_ fans are silent.
	- Fans will ramp up gradually until the liquid temperature hits 40째C which is when they will go 100%.
		- In my experience I don't go over 40째C unless I intentionally run stresstests for hours.
	- The `--verbose` option is more useful here as you can see how the fans will ramp up.

- Finally at the end we run `kraken_random_color.py` to get a new random color scheme. If we made it this far everything else should've gone fine.
